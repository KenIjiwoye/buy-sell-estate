# Buy / Sell Real Estate Platform

Building out a property listing app (i've done something similar for a local property firm located in Liberia, West Africa). I acquired the UI from a free theme resource (credit goes to BootstrapMade.com). I did this to save time on designing a UI from scratch.

I decided to go with Ruby on Rails on the backend for the same, which was to save on time and resources. I enjoy working in Rails, however I do not get that much time to work with it in my current projects.


More info will added soon! :)
